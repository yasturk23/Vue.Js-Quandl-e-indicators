Nasdaq Quandl API Key = PTViNcYniHvYxkpQ8YoS

This is just a simple Vue project to practice fetching economic data from Quandl and displaying it in a line chart.

Not the best project and really disappointed to find out that the datas I wanted were outdated. Maybe it is because I am using a free account.
I have only put in a couple of leading economic indicators for now.

Also I was disappointed to find out that if I wanted to fetch FRED data from the FRED website, I would be blocked due to a CORS policy.

I will try to find another data provider or try to build a web scraper in the future.

\*Not the best or most esthetic or cleanly written code but for the purpose of learning, it was a fun project.
